//1) Fetch the data from the link and use the data to create a sidebar component which will render a list of navitems. 
//2) Each navitem represents a file/folder.
//3) The folders should be expanded by default and should toggle between expanded and collapsed state on click.
//4) All the files/folders listed in a folder should have some space on the left to clearly indicate the hierarchical structure.
//Assume that the number of levels of nesting is not fixed. The solution should support any level of nesting.

export default function Sidebar() {
  return <div className="sidebar">Sidebar</div>;
}
